In Industry 4.0, condition monitoring is gaining significant importance due to its capability for early diagnosis of the symptoms of the faults that result in severe damage in the rotating machinery. Hydrodynamic conical journal bearings (HCJB) are used in heavy rotating machinery due to their high radial and axial load-carrying capacity and need to be adequately monitored during the operation. Thus an experimental study is carried out on a 
healthy and faulty CJB, which is scratched due to frequent start and stop machine operation, i.e. worn out internal surface material of bearing. Therefore, the dynamic response of a journal changes significantly due to wear. The vibration response of bearing in the time domain was acquired and transformed into the frequency domain and a comparative analysis is carried out. The experimental results demonstrate the unique vibration characteristic of worn-out bearing at the 4th multiple of operating frequency. Recently different machine learning techniques have been used as fault diagnosis approaches. A comparative study using different machine learning methods i.e. SVM(Support Vector Machine), k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) and RF (Random Forest) has been performed. The result shows that the RF classifier is more proficient in fault diagnosis with an accuracy of 93.93% compared to the other methods i.e. k-NN & SVM. 

Keywords: Condition monitoring, Hydrodynamic Conical Journal Bearing (HCJB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour), RF(Random Forest).
