🏫 I'm currently pursuing MS in Robotics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI). I have an innate passion for understanding how human perception and navigation work and how we can build real-world deployable autonomous systems with a positive societal impact.

🏎️ My research interests are deeply rooted in the world of autonomous vehicles, with a focus on self-driving cars, optimal control, and perception.
I'm particularly enthusiastic about advancing the field through self-supervised learning and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies.

🎶 Apart from research I'm a flautist and enjoy hiking and biking
